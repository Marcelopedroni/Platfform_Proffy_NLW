# Platfform_Proffy_NLW

This is the source code of a "mini bootcamp", named: NextLevel Week #2 provide by RockeatSeat, between 2020/August/03-07.

It contains all the files created to implement a study Plattform self-called "Proffy". 

We have an initial page where we can choose to give a class or order a class.
At the study page we can select the subject, weekday and time of our class.
At the give-classes page we do the register of the theachers, or "Proffys" as we call them. Once the register is properly fulfilled, the proffys datas will be persist at the database, and can show in the next search for classes.
